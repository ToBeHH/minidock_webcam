Webcam app for the Vobot MiniDock

This is a sleek webcam application powered by the LVGL graphics library.
You can configure up to 5 webcams in the vobot's application settings screen.
This app provides a distraction-free interface for users to browse through 
user's configured webcams. With an encoder knob, users can effortlessly 
switch between different webcams, allowing them to 
watch different places of the earth in real time with ease.
